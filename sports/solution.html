       <h1>THE solutions</h1><br>
       <p>School-based athletics is one of many solutions that support students. Sports In Schools believes our role is to support schools and communities to ensure ALL students have equitable access to play and schools have equitable access to quality equipment and apparel, so that student-athletes can experience the benefits that come with participating in school-based athletics. We support low-income, under resourced middle and high school-based athletic programs mostly in King and Pierce Counties in Washington State. By supporting these school communities, weâ€™re not only advancing our mission to increase access to opportunities by increasing access to sports in schools, but we are participating in creating healthy students and encouraging healthy lifestyles that will go beyond the classroom, field, court, mat, or track. To achieve our mission,<strong> we offer: </strong></p>
