       <h1>THE PROBLEMS</h1><br>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>Only 5% of youth ages 5-18 reported meeting the federally recommended amount of exercise of 60 minutes per day, 70% of youth stop playing sports by 13 years old (girls are twice as likely than boys to drop out of youth sports by the age of 14), and household wealth is a primary driver of kids athletic participation. Compared to their peers whose families make more than $100,000, youth ages 6-12 whose family income is under $25,000 are nearly three times as likely to be inactive. </li>
        <br>
         <li>Participation in school-based athletics has many short and long term benefits for student-athletes. Unfortunately, not all students have access to play and not all schools have adequate equipment and apparel. The reality is black and brown schools and communities are undeniably impacted more than affluent white schools and communities, and are likely to experience longer term health disparities due to the lack of adequate access to resources such as health care, food, and even athletics. </li>
